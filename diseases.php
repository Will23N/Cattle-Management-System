 	<h2>Diseases & Management of Infected Cattle</h2>
 </div>
 <h3>Anthrax</h3>
 <p style="font-size:medium;">Anthrax, a highly infectious and fatal disease of cattle, is caused by a relatively large spore-forming rectangular shaped bacterium called <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. Anthrax causes acute mortality in ruminants. The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are responsible for the ill effects, causing a high mortality rate.&nbsp;Signs of the illness usually appear 3 to 7 days after the spores are swallowed or inhaled. Once signs begin in animals, they usually die within two days.</p>
 <p style="font-size:medium;">Hoofed animals, such as deer, cattle, goats, and sheep, are the main animals affected by this disease. They usually get the disease by swallowing anthrax spores while grazing on pasture contaminated (made impure) with anthrax spores. Inhaling (breathing in) the spores, which are odorless, colorless, and tasteless, may also cause infection in animals and people.</p>
 <p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
 <ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Sudden death (often within 2 or 3 hours of being apparently normal) is by far the most common sign.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Very occasionally some animals may show trembling, a high temperature.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Difficulty breathing, collapse and convulsions before death. This usually occurs over a period of 24 hours.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">After death blood, may not clot, resulting in a small amount of bloody discharge from the nose, mouth and other openings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment and control </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Due to the acute nature of the disease resulting in sudden death, treatment is usually not possible in animals even though Anthrax bacilli are clines. Treatment is of use in cases showing sub-acute form of the disease.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">In most cases, early treatment can cure anthrax. The cutaneous (skin) form of anthrax can be treated with common antibiotics.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Preventive measures:</strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Regular annual vaccination of animals in endemic areas will prevent the disease from occurring.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Vaccination may be carried out at least a month prior to expected disease occurrence in endemic areas.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Never open a carcass of an animal suspected to have died from anthrax.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;">Contact a veterinarian immediately if the following symptoms are seen and seek advice on control measures to be adopted.</p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Fever (106-108°F), loss of appetite, depression and dullness.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Suspended rumination<span>3. Rapid pulse and heart rates.</span></li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Difficult breathing (dyspnoea).</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Lameness in affected leg.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Crepitation swelling over hip, back &amp; shoulder.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Swelling is hot &amp; painful in early stages whereas cold and painless inter.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Recumbency (prostration) followed by death within 12-48 hrs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Black quarter (black-leg)</h3>
<p style="font-size:medium;">It is an acute infectious and highly fatal, bacterial disease of cattle. Buffaloes, sheep and goats are also affected. Young cattle between 6-24 months of age, in good body condition are mostly affected. It is soil-borne infection which generally occurs during rainy season.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Causal organism</strong>: it is a bacterial disease caused by <i>Clostridium chauvoei</i></p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Symptoms: </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Fever (106-108°F), Loss of appetite, Depression and dullness.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Suspended rumination.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Rapid pulse and heart rates.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Difficult breathing (dyspnoea).</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Lameness in affected leg.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Crepitation swelling over hip, back & shoulder.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Swelling is hot & painful in early stages whereas cold and painless inter.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Recumbency (prostration) followed by death within 12-48 hrs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment</strong>:</p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Early treatment can be possible to complete cure of the animal.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Consult with veterinarian immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foot and Mouth Disease</h3>
<p style="font-size:medium;">The foot-and-mouth disease is a highly communicable disease affecting cloven-footed animals. It is characterized by fever, formation of vesicles and blisters in the mouth, udder, teats and on the skin between the toes and above the hoofs. Animals recovered from the disease present a characteristically rough coat and deformation of the hoof.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;">The disease spreads by direct contact or indirectly through infected water, manure, hay and pastures. It is also conveyed by cattle attendants. It is known to spread through recovered animals, field rats, porcupines and birds.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Symptoms </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;"> Fever with 104-105<sup>o</sup> F.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Profuse salivation - ropes of stringy saliva hangs from mouth. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Vesicles appear in mouth and in the inter digital space. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Lameness observed. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;"> Cross bred cattle are highly susceptible to it. </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">The external application of antiseptics contributes to the healing of the ulcers and wards off attacks by flies. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">A common and inexpensive dressing for the lesions in the feet is a mixture of coal-tar and copper sulphate in the proportion of 5:1. </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Precautions </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">Heavy milch animals and exotic breeds of cattle bred for milk should be protected regularly. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">It is advisable to carry out two vaccinations at an interval of six months followed by an annual vaccination programme. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Isolation and segregation of sick animals. It should be informed immediately to the veterinary doctor. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Disinfection of animal sheds with bleaching powder or phenol. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Attendants and equipment’s for sick animals should be ideally separate. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">The equipment’s should be thoroughly sanitized. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Proper disposal of left over feed by the animal. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Proper disposal of carcasses. </li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Control of flies. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Campylobactor abortion (vibriosis)</h3>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Transmission : </strong>Transmission occurs by coitus. The affected bulls carry the organisms in preputial cavity indefinitely. Mature cows and heifers also carry the infection for long periods. Infected semen from an infected bull is the important means of the disease. The organism survives low temperature used in semen storage.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Symptoms : </strong>Infertility may cause become apparent only when the percentage of pregnancies in a dairy herd is low. The infertility rate in heifers is more than in cows. Abortions usually occur between fifth and sixth month of pregnancy. Infected bulls show no symptoms and their semen is normal. Healthy bulls become infected during coitus with diseased cow. Among sheep the disease is characterized by abortion occurring towards the end of gestation. Usually abortion is preceded by vaginal discharge for several days. The aborted foetus is edematous with petechial hemorrhages on serous surfaces and necrotic foci in the liver.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Control </strong>; Abortion rate can be reduced by antibiotic therapy, and particularly by using chlortetracycline and concurrently with the development of specific immunity. The use of killed vaccines may reduce the incidence of disease in a herd but does not eradicate the infection. The bulls can be treated by injecting antibiotic cream in the prepuce. There is no direct treatment of females.</p>
<h3>Rinderpest</h3>
<p style="font-size:medium;">Rinderpest is the most destructive of the virus diseases of cloven-footed animals, such as cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and wild ruminants.&nbsp;The virus is found notable in the saliva, discharge from eyes and nostrils, and in the urine and faeces. It is present in the circulating blood during the febrile stage and is later concentrated in different organs, especially in the spleen, lymph nodes and liver. Outside the animal body, the virus is rapidly destroyed by direct sunlight and disinfectants. Cold preserves the virus. The virus is usually spread by contaminated feed and water. Rise in temperature up to 104 – 107 degree F. Lacrimation and redness of eye. Foul odour from mouth. Discrete necrotic foci develop in the buccal mucosa, inside lip, and on the tongue. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is noticed.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment: </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Symptomatic treatment can be help early cure of the animals. Consult with veterinary doctor</p>
<h3>Mastitis</h3>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Mastitis, or inflammation of the mammary gland, is the most common and the most expensive disease of dairy cattle throughout most of the world. Although stress and physical injuries may cause inflammation of the gland, infection by invading bacteria or other microorganisms (fungi, yeasts and possibly viruses) is the primary cause of mastitis. Infections begin when microorganisms penetrate the teat canal and multiply in the mammary gland.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">success depends on the nature of the aetiological agent involved, the severity of the disease and the extent of fibrosis.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">complete recovery with freedom from bacterial infection can be obtained in cases of recent infection and in those where fibrosis has taken place only to a small extent.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">such drugs as acriflavine, gramicidin and tyrothricin have now ceased to be in use, and have given place to the more effective drugs, such as sulphonamides, penicillin and streptomycin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="Default">Footrot<strong> </strong></h3>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Foot rot is a common cause of lameness in cattle and occurs most frequently when cattle on pasture are forced to walk through mud to obtain water and feed. However, it may occur among cattle in paddocks as well, under apparently excellent conditions. Foot rot is caused when a cut or scratch in the skin allows infection to penetrate between the claws or around the top of the hoof. Individual cases should be kept in a dry place and treated promptly with medication as directed by a veterinarian. If the disease becomes a herd problem a foot bath containing a 5% solution of copper sulphate placed where cattle are forced to walk though it once or twice a day will help to reduce the number of new infections. In addition, drain mud holes and cement areas around the water troughs where cattle are likely to pick up the infection. Keep pens and areas where cattle gather as clean as possible. Proper nutrition regarding protein, minerals and vitamins will maximize hoof health.</p>
<h3>Bovine rhinotracheitis</h3>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (ibr) is a highly contagious, infectious respiratory disease that is caused by bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1). It can affect young and older cattle. In addition to causing respiratory disease, this virus can cause conjunctivitis, abortions, encephalitis, and generalised systemic infections. Ibr is characterized by acute inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">There is no direct treatment for viral diseases. Infected animals should be isolated from the rest of the herd and treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for secondary infections if necessary. Carrier cattle should be identified and removed from the herd.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Control of the disease is based on the use of vaccines.</p>
<h3>Bovine babesiosis (tick fever)</h3>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Cause </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Bovine babesiosis (bb) is a tick-borne disease of cattle. Transmission of b bovis takes place when engorging adult female ticks pick up the infection. They pass it on to their progeny via their eggs. Larvae (or seed ticks) then pass it on in turn when feeding on another animal. B bigemina is also passed from one generation of ticks to the next. Engorging adult ticks pick up the infection and nymphal and adult stages (not larval stages) of the next generation pass it on to other cattle. Morbidity and mortality vary greatly and are influenced by prevailing treatments employed in an area, previous exposure to a species/strain of parasite, and vaccination status. In endemic areas, cattle become infected at a young age and develop a long-term immunity. However, outbreaks can occur in these endemic areas if exposure to ticks by young animals is interrupted or immuno-naïve cattle are introduced. The introduction of babesia infected ticks into previously tick-free areas may also lead to outbreaks of disease.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Symptoms: </strong></p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;">High fever.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Neurologic signs such as incoordination, teeth grinding and mania. Some cattle may be found on the ground with the involuntary movements of the legs. When the nervous symptoms of cerebral babesiosis develop, the outcome is almost always fatal.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Dark colored urine.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Anorexia.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Animals likely to separate from herd, be weak, depressed and reluctant to move.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">N b. Bigemina parasitaemia often exceeds 10 per cent and may be as high as 30 per cent.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:medium;">Clinical symptoms for babesia divergens<strong> </strong>are similar to b. Bigemina infections. The survivors may be weak and in reduced condition, although they usually recover fully. Subacute infections, with less apparent clinical signs, are also seen.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:medium;">Mild cases may recover without treatment. Sick animals can be treated with an antiparasitic drug. Treatment is most likely to be successful if the disease is diagnosed early; it may fail if the animal has been weakened by anemia. Imidocarb has been reported to protect animals from disease but immunity can develop. There are also concerns with regard to residues in milk and meat. In some cases blood transfusions and other supportive therapy should be considered.</p>
<p style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Effective control of tick fevers has been achieved by a combination of measures directed at both the disease and the tick vector. Tick control by acaracide dipping is widely used in endemic areas. Dipping may be done as frequently as every 4-6 weeks in heavily infested areas. The occurrence of resistance of ticks, chemical residues in cattle and environmental concerns over the continued use of insecticides has led to use of integrated strategies for tick control. Babesiosis vaccines are readily available and are highly effective. Anti-tick vaccines are also available in some countries and can be used as part of an integrated program for the control of ticks. Babesiosis can be eradicated by eliminating the host tick(s). In the us, this was accomplished by treating all cattle every two to three weeks with acaricides. In countries where eradication is not feasible, tick control can reduce the incidence of disease.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Treatment for control of tick (ethnovet): </strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">Mix common salt and few camphor in castor oil or neem oil and apply over the affected area. Whole plant extract of ghaner (lantana camara) should be diluted with the urine of cattle and apply externally. Boil 250 gm of tobacco in 2 litres of water and add 5 litres of water and sprayed over the body of 10-20 animals.</p>
<h3 class="Default">Ringworm</h3>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">This is the most common infectious skin disease affecting beef cattle. It is caused by a fungus, and is transmissible to man. Typically, the disease appears as crusty grey patches usually in the region of the head and neck and particularly around the eyes.</p>
<p class="Default" style="font-size:medium;">As a first step in controlling the disease, it is recommended that, whenever possible, affected animals should be segregated and their pens or stalls cleaned and disinfected. Clean cattle which have been in contact with the disease should be watched closely for the appearance of lesions and treated promptly. Proper nutrition, particularly high levels of vitamin a, copper and zinc while not a cure, will help to raise the resistance of the animal and in so doing offer some measure of control. Contact your vet and or feed store for products to treat this disease. Using a wormer like ivomec will kill lice and help prevent cattle from scratching causing skin damage and a place for the fungus to enter.</p>
<h3>Calf scour</h3>
<p style="font-size:medium;">Calves may develop scours due to bacterial or virus infections. Scours is known as "calf scours" or neonatal calf diarrhea. The primary causes of scours include: Rota virus, Corona virus, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>, Salmonella and <i>Escherichia coli</i>.</p>
<ul style="font-size:medium;">
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Determine if treatment is required.</strong> Calves that are moving around in the pasture, with their tails up, probably do not need treatment. Check to see if the diarrhea is yellow or white. If this is the case, treatment is probably not needed.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Determine if the calf is looking lifeless</strong>. <span>Calves that are lethargic or not participating much in the playful activities with other calves are a red flag to pay attention to. Calves that are also losing condition are also cause for alarm.</span></li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Check to see if the calf is dehydrated. </strong>You can check for dehydration by pulling on the calf's neck skin. If the skin "tents" this is a sign of dehydration.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Determine the calf's body temperature. </strong>A normal body temperature ranges from 100.5 °f (38.1 °c) to 102.5 °f (39.2 °c). Anything outside of this range is a sign for treatment.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Separate the sick calf or calves from the healthy herd. </strong>You'll want to do this to avoid spreading the disease further.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Administer fluids using your veterinarian-approved electrolyte solution. </strong>You may need to inject the fluids via iv or orally.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">Follow appropriate nursing care protocol using your vet's guidelines. This may include providing shelter, feed and a warm place to sleep.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;">A drawback from providing shelter is maintaining infectious control. You will have to work extra to get rid of soiled bedding and disinfect everything that a calf will touch, from the floor to the fence panels and even the feed bucket.</li>
<li style="color: #565656;"><strong>Enthnovet practice: </strong><i> Ingredients needed</i>: vasambu (<i>Acorus calamus</i>) leaves 2 numbers, dried ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale</i>) 50 gm, guava (<i>Psidium guajava</i>) tender leaves 200 gm.&nbsp;The above materials are ground and made into a bolus and administered orally one or two times.</li>
</ul>
